Certainly! From the provided information, it seems that the communication system is described in the context of a Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) setup involving a Base Station (BS), a reflecting Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS), and multiple single-antenna users. The system is designed to address scenarios where direct signal transmissions between the BS and users are minimal due to signal blockage.

Let's formulate the problem based on the True Environment Model and the Mismatch Environment Model.

### Problem Formulation:

#### True Environment Model:

1. **Objective:**
   - Maximize the overall system capacity or minimize the transmission power while maintaining a target signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

2. **Variables:**
   - \(\emptyset\): Phase-dependent reflection coefficients of the RIS.
   - \(x\): Transmission symbols from the BS.
   - \(y_k\): Received signals at user \(k\).
   - \(D_k\): Diagonal matrix representing individual cascaded channels to each user.

3. **Constraints:**
   - The reflection coefficients follow the model defined in Equation (2).
   - The BS has perfect knowledge of individual cascaded channels, as given in Equation (3).
   - Received signals are subject to additive noise.

4. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - Maximize \(\sum_{k=1}^{K} \log_2(1 + \text{SNR}_k)\), where \(\text{SNR}_k\) is the signal-to-noise ratio for user \(k\).
   - Subject to the constraints in Equations (2), (3), and (4).

#### Mismatch Environment Model:

1. **Objective:**
   - Minimize the impact of channel estimation errors on system performance.

2. **Variables:**
   - \(x\): Transmission symbols from the BS.
   - \(y_k\): Received signals at user \(k\).
   - \(D_k\): Diagonal matrix representing imperfectly estimated cascaded channels to each user.
   - \(E_k\): Channel estimation error matrix.

3. **Constraints:**
   - Reflections from the RIS are lossless.
   - The agent has access only to an imperfect estimate of cascaded channels, as given in Equation (5).
   - Received signals are subject to additive noise.

4. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - Minimize the impact of channel estimation errors, e.g., \(\sum_{k=1}^{K} \|E_k\|^2\).
   - Subject to the constraints in Equations (5).

These formulations provide a basis for optimization problems associated with the True Environment Model and the Mismatch Environment Model in the described communication system. The specific choice of objective function and constraints may vary depending on the goals and requirements of the system.
